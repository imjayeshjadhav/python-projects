# 🎲 Roll & Race: Dice Game (Python)

Welcome to **Roll & Race**, a fun turn-based dice game built with Python where **you play against the AI**.  
The first to reach 30 points **wins the game** — but beware! Rolling a **1 resets your turn score** to zero!


## 🚀 Game Overview

- 🎯 **Goal**: Be the first player to reach **30 points**
- 🎲 **How it works**:
  - Players take turns rolling a die.
  - You can roll multiple times in one turn to accumulate a turn score.
  - **But** if you roll a **1**, your turn ends and the score for that turn resets to **0**.
  - You can choose to stop at any time and **bank** your current score.

## 🧠 AI Strategy

The AI plays smart — it will keep rolling until its **turn score is 10 or more**, then it holds.


## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🎲 `random` module for dice rolls
- ⏱️ `time.sleep()` for delay simulation
